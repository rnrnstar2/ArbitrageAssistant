# Proposed Monorepo Structure for Next.js 15, Tauri, and Amplify Gen2

## Overview and Rationale

We organize the project into clearly separated directories for front-end apps, the Amplify Gen2 backend, and shared libraries. This ensures each part has a single responsibility, making the monorepo easy to navigate and scalable. The structure follows modern best practices (using Turborepo with npm workspaces) and adheres to Amplify Gen2’s official patterns for defining **auth**, **data**, and **functions**, preventing a messy or redundant layout. The goal is to support an MVP that can grow over time, with a layout that enables parallel development (even by AI assistants) on different parts of the codebase without conflicts.

## Roles and Responsibilities of Each Part

* **apps/** – Houses the front-end applications. In this monorepo, we have:

  * **admin/**: A Next.js 15 web application for administrators. It uses the App Router (the new file-based routing in Next.js 13+), React 19, and Tailwind CSS v4 for styling. Its responsibility is to provide a modern web UI for admin users. It’s kept isolated from other parts of the monorepo, so its UI code and configuration (Next.js settings, Tailwind config, etc.) are self-contained. This app will consume the shared **api** package for data (GraphQL queries) and could reuse shared UI components.
  * **hedge-system/**: A Tauri-based desktop application. This folder contains both the Rust backend and the front-end code for the desktop app. The **src-tauri/** subdirectory holds Rust code (the Tauri main process), which creates the application window and handles native capabilities. The **src/** directory contains the web UI that will be rendered in Tauri’s WebView (likely a React app or similar, built with a bundler like Vite). This separation within the app ensures that the Rust and TS/JS code don’t interfere. The hedge-system app is responsible for delivering a desktop experience, possibly for end-users, and will also utilize the shared **api** package to communicate with the same backend. By structuring it here, we ensure the desktop app can be built and run independently of the admin web app, even though they share some code.

* **packages/** – Contains shared libraries that can be imported by any app:

  * **api/**: This is a crucial package that centralizes the GraphQL **client logic and data type definitions** for the Amplify backend. By having an `api` library, both the Next.js app and the Tauri app can use the exact same GraphQL queries, mutation definitions, and TypeScript types for API responses. This avoids duplicate code and keeps the data access consistent. For example, this package might export an Apollo Client instance or a set of functions using `fetch` to call the AppSync GraphQL endpoint. It will include GraphQL operation documents and the TypeScript types for the schema – these types can be generated from the Amplify schema (using codegen or Amplify’s **`Schema`** type). In Amplify Gen2, the backend defines a `Schema` type in `amplify/data/resource.ts` that reflects the GraphQL models. We can leverage that for end-to-end type safety. This design allows updating API queries in one place and immediately sharing them across apps.
  * **ui/** (optional): A shared UI components library. In a growing project, it’s wise to factor out common UI elements (for consistency and to help parallel development). This package could hold a design system: React components (like buttons, modals, form controls) and perhaps common styling or Tailwind configurations. Both the admin Next.js app and the Tauri app (if it uses React or a web tech UI) can import these components to ensure a consistent look and reduce duplicated UI code. While not strictly required for an MVP, having a `ui` library early can pave the way for faster UI development and a unified style guide across apps. (If not needed initially, this package can be added later without disrupting the structure.)

* **amplify/** – Contains the **AWS Amplify Gen 2 backend** definitions. This is essentially the “infrastructure as code” portion of the project, written in TypeScript using Amplify’s new code-first approach. By keeping it in its own top-level directory (with its own package.json and tsconfig), we isolate backend cloud logic from frontend code. Amplify’s structure is organized by **categories**, each represented as a subfolder:

  * **auth/**: Defines authentication via Amazon Cognito. The `auth/resource.ts` file uses `defineAuth()` to configure the user pool (e.g. enabling email/password login, MFA, etc.). Collocated with it are any authentication triggers (Lambda functions that respond to Cognito events like user sign-up or sign-in). For example, `post-confirmation.ts` is a function that runs after a new user confirms their account, which we might use to create a default profile in the database. Similarly, `pre-sign-up.ts` could enforce custom validation or auto-confirm logic, and `custom-message.tsx` can customize emails. Placing these in the **auth** folder keeps all auth-related logic together, following Amplify Gen2’s guidance to “collocate resources depending on their function” (in this case, all Cognito-related resources in one place).
  * **data/**: Defines the GraphQL API and data models. In Amplify Gen2, `data/resource.ts` is the central place to define our **schema** using a code-first syntax. We use `a.model()` to define data models (which under the hood creates DynamoDB tables and a full AppSync GraphQL API for CRUD operations on those models). For example, if we define a model `Todo` with fields (like in Amplify’s tutorial), Amplify will automatically set up a DynamoDB table and GraphQL queries, mutations, and subscriptions for that model. We can also define custom queries or mutations using `a.query()` or `a.mutation()` if needed. The **data** folder can include a `schema.ts` to organize complex schema parts (or to separate type definitions if the single `resource.ts` gets too large). Additionally, a **resolvers/** subfolder holds custom AWS Lambda resolvers for our GraphQL API. Amplify allows extending the AppSync API by linking custom functions – for example, if we need a specialized query like `listTopHedgeFunds`, we could write a resolver function and attach it to the schema via `a.query()` pointing to that function. In our structure, a file like `resolvers/customQuery.ts` would implement such logic. This separation means all GraphQL/data logic is in one place. The data models and API definitions here will be the source of truth for the front-end to know what data is available.
  * **functions (jobs/)/**: Contains **Lambda functions** for any backend logic not covered by the out-of-the-box GraphQL resolvers. Amplify Gen2 lets you define functions via `defineFunction()`, including the ability to schedule them on cron-like timers. In our structure, we use a **jobs/** folder to group scheduled tasks (the example `daily-task` runs every day). Each function has its own subfolder with a `resource.ts` (the infrastructure definition) and the actual `handler` code (TypeScript or other supported runtime). For instance, `daily-task/resource.ts` might use `defineFunction({ name: "daily-task", schedule: "every day" })` to run daily, and the `handler.ts` will contain the code that executes (perhaps summarizing data, sending notifications, etc.). These scheduled jobs use Amazon EventBridge under the hood to trigger the Lambdas on schedule. Aside from scheduled jobs, this category can also include on-demand Lambdas or background processors: if we had a function that isn’t on a schedule, we could still define it here (without a schedule property) and perhaps call it from our app or attach it as a resolver. By isolating all such cloud functions in **jobs/** (or a similar **functions/** directory), we clarify that these are our backend compute pieces. This makes it easy for developers (or AI agents) to find and modify backend logic, and prevents mixing Lambda code with the front-end code.
  * **backend.ts**: This is the entry point where Amplify is informed about all the above resources. We use `defineBackend()` to assemble our auth, data, and function definitions into a single backend that Amplify can deploy. In this file, we import `auth` from `auth/resource.ts`, `data` from `data/resource.ts`, and each function (e.g., import `dailyTask` from `jobs/daily-task/resource.ts`), then pass them to `defineBackend({ auth, data, dailyTask, ... })`. This explicit listing helps new contributors see at a glance which major resources are part of the backend. Amplify will deploy these as a cohesive unit. This file is also where we could integrate any **additional AWS resources** via CDK constructs if needed (for example, an S3 bucket for file storage, as Amplify Gen2 allows mixing in CDK code). That means our structure is future-proof: if we decide to add file storage, we might create an **amplify/storage/** folder or simply use `backend.ts` to define an S3 bucket and permissions, keeping that logic grouped with the backend code.
  * The **amplify/** directory as a whole is a standalone Node project. It has its own `package.json` (including `@aws-amplify/backend` library and potentially `aws-cdk` dependencies) and a TypeScript config. This isolation means running Amplify CLI commands or deploying the backend can be done independently from the front-end builds. It also means the backend team (or an AI agent focusing on cloud infra) can work in this folder without touching front-end code. Amplify will output an **`amplify_outputs.json`** file after deployment/sandbox, which contains the AppSync API endpoint, API key, and other identifiers. We do **not** commit secrets, but this outputs file (or environment variables configured similarly) will be used by the front-end (especially the `packages/api` client) to configure network calls to the cloud.

* **Root configuration** – At the root, we include:

  * **turbo.json**: The Turborepo configuration, which defines how tasks are run across the monorepo. For example, it might define a pipeline where when code in `packages/api` changes, both the admin and hedge-system apps should rebuild (since they depend on it). Turborepo will also help cache builds and tests, speeding up CI/CD for the MVP. It’s configured to recognize our apps and packages, enabling commands like `turbo run build` to build all projects in the correct order.
  * **package.json** (workspace root): Defines the npm workspaces and any root-level devDependencies. Here we list `apps/admin`, `apps/hedge-system`, `packages/api`, `packages/ui`, and `amplify` as workspaces. This means running `npm install` (or `pnpm/yarn install`) will install dependencies for all sub-projects and link the packages together. For instance, the admin app’s `node_modules` will use the local `packages/api` instead of a separate copy, allowing live development against the shared library.
  * **tsconfig.base.json**: A base TypeScript configuration that sets common compiler options (like target ECMAScript version, module resolution, path aliases for imports such as `@/amplify/*` or shared utils, etc.). Each project’s tsconfig can extend this base. This ensures consistency (for example, both the Next.js app and the Tauri UI use the same JSX factory settings, strict mode, etc.), and simplifies managing TS settings.

## Amplify Gen2: Auth, Data, Functions Integration

The proposed structure strictly follows Amplify Gen2’s latest recommendations for organizing backend resources. Amplify’s new **code-first** approach means our **`amplify`** folder is essentially a code representation of cloud resources, rather than the old CLI JSON/YAML files. By splitting the backend into logical subfolders (auth, data, functions), we achieve a clean separation of concerns:

* **Auth**: Everything related to authentication and user accounts is in one place. The Cognito configuration (user pool settings) is defined in code, and any function that directly ties to authentication lives alongside it (for example, creating a user record in DynamoDB after confirmation). This makes it easy to manage user-related security rules and to extend auth with triggers without touching unrelated parts of the backend.
* **Data (GraphQL API)**: The heart of the backend – our data models and API – is defined under `data/`. Using `defineData` with a schema object, we get an AppSync GraphQL endpoint and DynamoDB tables automatically provisioned for each model. We’ve structured it so that any custom business logic for data (like special queries or complex operations) can be added as Lambda resolvers in the `resolvers/` subfolder and referenced in the schema. This means we’re not constrained by a simple CRUD schema; we can evolve our API with custom capabilities. The Amplify framework will handle generating the types for queries and mutations for our models (create, update, delete, list, get) out of the box, which accelerates development. By keeping this in its own module, front-end developers or AI agents can easily find the data contract of the app (and even generate front-end types from it).
* **Functions/Jobs**: Any serverless function is clearly defined either alongside the category it relates to (e.g., an auth trigger under auth, a file upload trigger under storage) or in the jobs folder for standalone tasks. For example, scheduled tasks are defined in `jobs/` with clear naming (`daily-task`, `weekly-digest`, etc.), making their purpose obvious. Amplify Gen2 supports natural language scheduling (like `"every week"`) for these functions, and under the hood uses EventBridge rules to trigger them at those intervals. This opens the door for use cases like periodic data processing, cleaning up old records, sending summary emails, etc., all without manual Cron jobs on a server. By separating them from the core data and auth definitions, we ensure these jobs can be developed and tested independently. If needed, we could also include non-scheduled Lambda functions here (for example, a function that runs on-demand, perhaps invoked via an AppSync resolver or API Gateway). Those could be placed in a **functions/** subfolder or integrated in the jobs structure with a clear name. The key is that all such compute logic is not mixed into the front-end apps or scattered – it’s centrally located in the backend code.

Importantly, the **Amplify backend code is in TypeScript**, so it lives in the same monorepo and can even share types with front-end if appropriate. For instance, the `amplify/data/resource.ts` exports a `Schema` type (client schema) that corresponds to the GraphQL API. We could utilize that in our `packages/api` for 100% type-safe API calls (the Amplify docs demonstrate using it with their `generateClient` function for end-to-end typing). Even if we use Apollo or a custom fetch client instead of Amplify’s client, we can still generate equivalent TypeScript types (e.g., via GraphQL Codegen) based on the same schema to ensure our queries in `packages/api` align with the backend.

## Shared GraphQL Client Package

By designing a dedicated **`packages/api`** library, we ensure that both the Next.js admin and the Tauri app share the same code for interacting with the backend. This package will abstract away the details of making requests to AppSync:

* It can read the endpoint/credentials from Amplify’s output (e.g., using the `amplify_outputs.json` or environment variables for the deployed API URL and API key). This means neither front-end needs to hardcode those details – they pull from a common source. (During local development, Amplify’s *sandbox* mode can populate `amplify_outputs.json` with a local AppSync URL and API key, which the `api` package can use for testing).
* It defines all GraphQL operations (queries, mutations, subscriptions) that the apps might need. For example, if our data models include `Hedge` and `Portfolio`, the `api` package might provide functions like `getHedge(id)`, `listHedges()`, `createHedge(input)` etc., corresponding to GraphQL operations. Under the hood, these could be implemented with Apollo Client’s `query/mutate` calls or with `fetch` calls using `fetch(API_URL, { query: ... })`. By centralizing them, if the GraphQL schema changes or if we switch from API key auth to Cognito user pool auth, we can update the logic in one place.
* It includes **TypeScript types** for the data. This is crucial for developer (and AI) productivity. Whether we import the Amplify-generated types or run a codegen, the `api/types.ts` will have interfaces or types for, say, `Hedge`, `Portfolio`, and the shapes of queries and mutations. Both frontends can import these types to ensure they handle data correctly. For instance, the admin app might import `Hedge` type to type-check the props for a Hedge editing component.
* If using Apollo, this package can also encapsulate the Apollo Client instance creation (with caches, links, etc.), exporting a `<ApolloProvider>` component or similar for the apps to use. This way, the Apollo configuration (e.g., using `InMemoryCache` and possible AppSync links) is not duplicated in two places. If using a simpler fetch approach, it could export utility functions instead.
* Another advantage: **Testing**. We could write tests for the `api` package’s functions (mocking network calls) without involving the UI. This keeps data logic separate from presentation.

## Maintaining Clarity and Extensibility

This proposed structure keeps the monorepo organized and lean:

* Each app and package has a **well-defined responsibility**. For example, the admin app is purely for UI and doesn’t contain any backend code or shared logic; the Amplify folder only contains infrastructure-as-code and no React/UI code at all. This modularization prevents the bloat that often plagues monorepos. Developers (or AI agents like Claude) can quickly navigate to the relevant folder for the task at hand (be it UI tweaks, adding a new data model, or writing a new scheduled job).
* We avoid naming ambiguity and deeply nested paths beyond what’s necessary. The top-level separation (apps vs packages vs amplify) means, for instance, that adding a new front-end (say, a mobile app in the future) is straightforward – you’d create `apps/mobile/` without interfering with existing code. Similarly, adding a new backend function is just a new folder under `amplify/jobs/` or appropriate category.
* **Amplify Gen2 compliance**: The structure is aligned with Amplify’s official layout. The Amplify documentation shows a scaffold with `amplify/auth/resource.ts` and `amplify/data/resource.ts` by default, and how a project may grow with resolvers, triggers, and jobs organized in subfolders. We have mirrored that approach, which means our backend is using the latest Amplify syntax (e.g., `defineAuth`, `defineData`, `defineFunction`) exactly as intended. This ensures smooth integration with Amplify CLI and hosting – the Amplify CLI will recognize our definitions and be able to push them to AWS without error, since we’re following the expected convention.
* **Scalability**: While the structure is MVP-friendly (not overly complex), it’s set up for growth. For example, if we need to introduce a new Amplify category (like storage for file uploads, or analytics for Pinpoint), we can add `amplify/storage/resource.ts` or `amplify/analytics/resource.ts` in a similar fashion. They won’t clutter other areas. If the team decides to factor out more libraries (say a `packages/utils` for utility functions, or split `api` into `api-types` and `api-client`), the packages directory is already there to host them. Turborepo will handle any new additions easily by configuration.
* **Parallel development**: Because of the clear-cut boundaries, multiple developers or AI agents can work simultaneously. For instance, one could be building a new page in the Next.js admin, while another is writing a new Lambda in the Amplify backend, and a third is updating a shared component in the UI library – all without stepping on each other’s toes. The monorepo’s tooling (with atomic commits and possibly tests for each package) will catch integration issues early, and the contract between front-end and back-end (the GraphQL schema and types) is clearly defined in one place. This reduces integration bugs and makes code reviews more focused (you can review just the `amplify/` changes or just the `apps/admin` changes, etc.).

In summary, this directory setup provides a **modern, maintainable monorepo** for a full-stack project. It keeps the **roles** of each part explicit: Next.js app for admin UI, Tauri app for desktop UI, an Amplify Gen2 backend for cloud resources (using proper auth/data/functions separation), and shared packages for any common code (data access and UI toolkit). This clarity not only prevents the monorepo from becoming unwieldy at MVP stage, but also establishes a strong foundation for future features and team scaling. Each concern is isolated but easily accessible, which aligns with best practices for monorepos and Amplify’s recommended project structuring. The result is a clean, extensible architecture ready for development and deployment.
